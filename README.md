# Problem Statement 1- 

Problem – To find out which show the person watched first after buying an OTT’s subscription plan.



![Q1 A](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90283295/139030552-d731f8e9-75ad-408c-8d6e-c2741e61b6fb.JPG)

Solution – We have used lag to find out what the first entry is on the basis of username for the person after they have bought the subscription.
We created a new variable called 1st_show, we denoted the value of 1 against it, when it was the first entry for a distinct user_id after purchasing the subscription.
Then we recalled our final solution by asking SQL to return, the show column as first show and user_id where the 1st_show variable had the value of 1.
Hence, we get our desired result.

# Problem Statement 2-


Recruitment-Assignment---SQL

We clean the data and then find out who was recruited by whom and to
which department.

Problem –
1. A list of all employees recruited by Paul Allen
2. A list of employees in Marketing recruited by John Do
3. Output the count of employees in each department

Approach-

1- First, we drop all the null columns F5 and F8.

2- We separated Employee data into a new table called EmplyeeBD

3- We deleted all the null values from EmplyeeBD table to get all the
relevant Employee Data.

4- We rename all the columns for our easier understanding.

5- We perform the similar steps (2-4) and create table for RecruitrBD
and DeptBD.

6- We then join the EmplyeeBD and RecruitrID using common column
RecruiterID and name the table RecruitrDeptJoined

7- We then join the RecruiterDeptJoined and Dept ID using common
column DepartmentID. We get a new table with all the data and in a
better way.
